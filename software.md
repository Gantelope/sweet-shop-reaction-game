# Software Installation

You will be creating your program using ScratchGPIO rather than Scratch. [To download and install ScratchGPIO see here](http://cymplecy.github.io/scratch_gpio/). It is very similar in almost all aspects. If you are not familiar with the Scratch interface then [see the Scratch Raspberry Pi Manual here - Page 8](http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/download/Raspberry_Pi_Education_Manual.pdf). We need to use ScratchGPIO so that you can make a button to control your game using the General Purpose Input Output pins on the Raspberry Pi.
